    <h1>Konrad Zuse</h1>
    <p> 
      Konrad Zuse, a German engineer, sat hunched over a cluttered desk in his small Berlin apartment, quietly working on his machine that would change the course of computing history. In 1936, he built the Z3, the world's first programmable computer, using metal parts and a system of relays. Zuse's invention was made without help but was also largely unrecognized, as a war was happening in Europe. Years later, when asked about his work, Zuse simply said, "I was always more interested in the potential of machines than in acknowledgment of others."
